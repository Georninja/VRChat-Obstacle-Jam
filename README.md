# VRChat Obstacle Course Demo Project

This project was created for our [second World Jam](https://itch.io/jam/vrchat-obstacle-jam), and serves as a fun starter kit for a Time Trial game world!
It's built to be usable by creators with little-to-no Udon experience, you can just snap together a new course using the existing models, or creating / importing your own.
